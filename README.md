## What's this?

This repo contains some tools that may come in handy when working with MXF essence files as found on P2 cards used in panasonic camcorders.

mergeMXF takes files from the card's folder structure and merges video and audio tracks. 

p2_cuesheet thakes the metadata from the xml files to generate a html document with thumbnails and shot times (and groups files that belong to the same shot)
